SCROOGE TOOK HIS MELANCHOLY DINNER IN HIS USUAL MELANCHOLY TAVERN; AND HAVING READ ALL THE NEWSPAPERS, AND BEGUILED THE REST OF THE EVENING WITH HIS BANKERâ€™S-BOOK, WENT HOME TO BED. HE LIVED IN CHAMBERS WHICH HAD ONCE BELONGED TO HIS DECEASED PARTNER. THEY WERE A GLOOMY SUITE OF ROOMS, IN A LOWERING PILE OF BUILDING UP A YARD, WHERE IT HAD SO LITTLE BUSINESS TO BE, THAT ONE COULD SCARCELY HELP FANCYING IT MUST HAVE RUN THERE WHEN IT WAS A YOUNG HOUSE, PLAYING AT HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH OTHER HOUSES, AND FORGOTTEN THE WAY OUT AGAIN. IT WAS OLD ENOUGH NOW, AND DREARY ENOUGH, FOR NOBODY LIVED IN IT BUT SCROOGE, THE OTHER ROOMS BEING ALL LET OUT AS OFFICES. THE YARD WAS SO DARK THAT EVEN SCROOGE, WHO KNEW ITS EVERY STONE, WAS FAIN TO GROPE WITH HIS HANDS. THE FOG AND FROST SO HUNG ABOUT THE BLACK OLD GATEWAY OF THE HOUSE, THAT IT SEEMED AS IF THE GENIUS OF THE WEATHER SAT IN MOURNFUL MEDITATION ON THE THRESHOLD.
